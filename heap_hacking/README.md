### Hacking the Virtual Memory


Every processâ€™s executable is stored on-disk, when we execute a C program the program loader transfers the binary code from on-disk program to memory. <br />The kernel has to allocate an additional space in memory as and when needed by the process.

### mem- Memory held by this process.

> /proc/PID/maps 

Compile C : 

```bash 
$ gcc heap.c -o heap
$ ./heap
``` 

We see `Hello! Heap!`, Now we can use `/proc/<PID>/maps` read heap message,

```bash 
$ egrep heap 
$ python3 read_heap.py 
```

We see `Hello! Heap!`, also we can write message this message with PID, 

```bash 
$ python3 read_write_heap.py
Usage: read_write_heap.py pid search_s replace_s
```
